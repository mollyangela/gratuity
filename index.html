<h2> <a href="https://gratuitycalculator.imollyangela.workers.dev/">How to Calculate Gratuity in UAE? </a></h2>

<h2> Key Factors Influencing Gratuity Amount </h2>
<p>Several factors play a crucial role in determining the amount of gratuity an employee receives in Dubai. Here are the most significant ones:</p>
<h3>    Basic Salary </h3>
<p>The basic salary is the primary factor in gratuity calculations. Only the basic salary is considered, excluding allowances, bonuses, or other benefits. </p>

<h3> Calculation Impact </h3>
    <p>    A higher basic salary directly increases the gratuity amount. For instance, if an employee has a basic salary of AED 10,000, their gratuity will be significantly higher than that of an employee earning AED 5,000.</p>

<h3>Duration of Service</h3>
<p>The length of time an employee has worked for the same employer also affects gratuity calculations. </p>

<h3>Service Years</h3>
<p>  Employees must complete at least one year of continuous service to be eligible for gratuity. The longer the duration of service, the higher the gratuity amount.</p>  

<h3>Calculation Method</h3> 
    <p>The gratuity is calculated based on the number of years worked:
  - For the first five years: 21 days of salary for each year.
  - For each additional year beyond five: 30 days of salary for each year.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In summary, several factors influence the amount of gratuity an employee receives in Dubai, including basic salary, duration of service, type of employment contract, termination circumstances, company policies, and changes in employment status. Understanding these factors can help you better navigate your end-of-service benefits and plan for your financial future. Utilizing a gratuity calculator Dubai can further streamline the process, providing you with accurate estimates based on your specific circumstances.</p>
